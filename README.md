# Solving a Multiple Knapsacks Problem

Multidimensional knapsack problems, in which the items have more than one physical quantity, such as weight and volume, and the knapsack has a capacity for each quantity. Here, the term dimension does not necessarily refer to the usual spatial dimensions of height, length, and width. However, some problems might involve spatial dimensions, for example, finding the optimal way to pack rectangular boxes into a rectangular storage bin.

This section shows how to solve the knapsack problem for multiple knapsacks using both the MIP solver and the CP-SAT solver. In this case, it's common to refer to the containers as bins, rather than knapsacks.

Hapag-Lloyd AG is a German international shipping and container transportation company. Hapag-Lloyd was formed in 1970 through a merger of Hamburg-American Line (HAPAG) and Norddeutscher Lloyd.

In this project, we want to pack as more as possible items in the four 20' Standard Hapag Lloyd container.
